sift-java
=========

Java library which help integrate your Java application to Sift Science (http://www.siftscience.com) quicker and easier.

This library has been made using Jersey (https://jersey.java.net) for the transport layer and Jackson JSON Processor (http://jackson.codehaus.org) as (de)serializer.

1. Installation (using Maven)
-----------------------------

The library is not distributed anywhere yet, so you will need to `mvn install` it and add the following dependency to your project:

```
<dependency>  
	<groupId>com.mcac0006.siftscience</groupId>  
	<artifactId>sift-java</artifactId>  
	<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>  
</dependency>
```

2. How to use
-------------
```
import com.mcac0006.siftscience.SiftScienceHelper;
import com.mcac0006.siftscience.result.domain.SiftScienceResponse;
import com.mcac0006.siftscience.event.domain.*;
```

```
final SiftScienceHelper helper = new SiftScienceHelper('API_KEY_GOES_HERE'); // instantiate the helper
```

```
// Sending a an Event is easy! Let's create a Transaction ($transaction) event.
final Event event = new Transaction(); // create an event
event.setX(...).setY(...).setZ(...); //fill in all fields using setters

// ... you can also add custom fields of your own to any event!
event.addCustomField('key1', 'value1');
event.addCustomField('key2', 'value2');
...

final SiftScienceResponse ssr = helper.send(event); //send the event to SiftScience

```

```
// Labels are also created in the same fashion
final Label label = new Label(); // create an event
label.setX(...).setY(...).setZ(...); //fill in all fields using setters

final SiftScienceResponse ssr = helper.send(event); //send the event to SiftScience
```

```
// If you're interested in getting the SiftScore for that particular user ...
final SiftScienceScore score = helper.getScore('mcac0006');
// Use the getters to retrieve the score information, such as ...
score.getScore();
```


**Do you have a custom event of your own?**

3. Creating a custom event of your own (is easy!)
----

1. Create your own Java class and extend `com.mcac0006.siftscience.event.domain.Event`

2. Create your private attributes and their getters and setters

3. Make sure you override and implement the equals() method. You will need it for your JUnit test (below).

4. **Recommended!** Create at least one JUnit test to make sure your class is being serialized properly. Check out `com.mcac0006.services.siftscience.SiftScienceBodyTest` to have a better idea on how this is done with the standard Event classes.
